*Welcome to the source code repository of my personal website available at [tsin.is](https://tsin.is)*

## Description

You will definitely not find here fancy architecture and state management (since there is no global states at all), or advanced navigation, there is no business and therefore no business logic. It's a simple, one-page static website made in Flutter. Perhaps you will like animations or design solutions â€” then you are in the right place. Thank you for the visit!
